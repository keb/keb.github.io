&lt;p&gt;In it&#x27;s current state, I don&#x27;t find this game very interesting. If you&#x27;re ever played an open-world first person RPG before, this game is filled with every cliche in the book. Still, I can&#x27;t deny the high production values and sheer scale. I hope to revisit in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the day you became our family was the day we first met you. you came to our home with your twin brother. you were the most peculiar looking dog i had ever seen, and the most peculiar dog any of us had ever seen. your ears were soft and droopy, and your fur soft and short. they enveloped your little face, with no fur on it except for little patches around your nose and mouth like feathers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235331843-a3ae5656-4a4a-4380-9797-ffecd677b2dc.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235331843-a3ae5656-4a4a-4380-9797-ffecd677b2dc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;0009_Flitch 001 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but your most peculiar feature was your most notable: where had the hair on your head gone? it became evident right away why you were here. your owners couldn&#x27;t sell you or your brother because you came out looking like this. the ugly ducklings of the litter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235331940-45c217e2-bb5e-4330-9c15-526ad8fc6528.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235331940-45c217e2-bb5e-4330-9c15-526ad8fc6528.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;0010_Flitch 002 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it didn&#x27;t matter to us because you were a gift, literally, and figuratively. you were brought to stay. who would have known you would become the center of our universe? that every moment there on would revolve around you and the way you interacted with the world in your new home? i didn&#x27;t think much else other than i was happy to have a dog now. kids my age don&#x27;t have much foresight. i was 13 years old, self-conscious and still afraid of school and people. my memories of having a pet before this were marked with a vague sadness, guilt, and lack of closure. our first dog, Scrappy, disappeared to me when i moved to New York for treatment. our hamsters, Cui and Cuddles, similarly were gone and I was always too afraid to ask the adults what had happened. maybe this was a chance for us to make things right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we discuss names. what should we call you? that same year, the video game Nintendogs had come out on the Nintendo DS. in the game, I had chosen a husky puppy as my digital pet and named him after a random user I saw on a video game forum, only because i thought their username sounded like a good pet name. it was Flitch. i remember being so convinced that it was a perfect name for you. i think there was so little debate when the name came up when you arrived. Flitch had arrived to our home at last, but you were no husky. you were unlike any dog we had ever seen before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that night, you slept in the room with my brother and I. we had a small basket that we turned into a makeshift bed, lined with soft blankets. it sat on the floor between our beds, so we could see you while you sleep. but instead of sleeping when the nights went out, you cried. every few seconds you would whimper as if you were scared. we thought it must have been the darkness. the following night, we got you a nightlight, insistent that this would quell your fears. but you were never afraid of the dark. you were never afraid of anything, you just wanted to be loved, and for us to lay there next to you. when we finally do, you stop crying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235332391-77352b47-6886-460a-ae9f-7d98909e26a3.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235332391-77352b47-6886-460a-ae9f-7d98909e26a3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;0013_Flitch 006 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;days pass. you no longer cry in the darkness. you begin exploring your new house, stretching your 3 week old legs as far as they could go. we had no pet supplies, so you ate from one of our bowls that we would haphazardly place on the tile floors. i can&#x27;t even remember if we gave you the proper food for a dog your age, but your appetite was always healthy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you grow quickly. your puppy fuzz is replaced with translucent, wispy locks that appear golden in the sunlight. your thick tail curls itself upward, and you decide to keep it that way. we never groom you because we decide you are perfect the way you are. you become so comfortable in your new home, your personality begins to conquer our attention every day. no room in the house is off limits to you. you are always the center of attention when we&#x27;re not distracted by our video games, computers, or television. you are the center of attention when mom and pa come home from work, and you rush to the door to greet them. your playfulness knows no bounds, and you begin jumping on furniture, often to impressive heights. the top of the sofa becomes your perch, where you can survey your home at our eye level. you jump on our beds, and regularly take naps or sleep the night there. if only you could have done that when you were only 2 weeks old. one of our favorite games is hiding behind a pillow and watching as you try to fight your way through it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your fur grows quickly. it&#x27;s long, and you have a mane now. we remark how you often look like a tiny lion. the kingliness of your lion-esque appearance contrasts your peculiar baldness. despite your hair growing, your head and underside remain bald as the day you were born. it&#x27;s smooth, and makes it easy to pet you, rub your belly, and give you small kisses. your small head must have received millions of kisses. at least one hundred per day by everyone of us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235333513-2d0ae2de-996e-4be2-815b-cc60df18c5ee.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235333513-2d0ae2de-996e-4be2-815b-cc60df18c5ee.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;victor_2014 056 (18)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235332757-6cddb891-0e5e-41b6-9e61-661d67e721e3.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235332757-6cddb891-0e5e-41b6-9e61-661d67e721e3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;0021_Flitch 013 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your energy knows no bounds. playtime is everyday and frequent. we chase you around the coffee table, lunging at you to trick you into running in the opposite direction. you scramble around the carpet, your little feet struggling to keep up with your speed. once you&#x27;d run so fast on the tile flooring, that you lose your footing and run into a wall down the hallway. your ears would tilt to the sides when you&#x27;d stop, look at us, and bark. your voice is small and commanding, but never shrill.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after a few indoor accidents, we learn that walking you is an absolute necessity. this will be my primary form of exercise for the rest of my teenage years. when you go for walks, you never want to stop. you command that we walk further every time. walks can last up to 40 minutes at times. even more when rafael walks you alone. he&#x27;ll take you to and from the other neighborhoods down the major roads. you almost never care how hot it is outside. sometimes i try to trick you by picking you up, and turning you 180 degrees. it works once, and never again. you&#x27;re too smart for that. walks become your favorite parts of the day. the sound of us opening the drawer where your leash is rings your alarms that it&#x27;s time to walk again. your greatest trick is to ask more than one of us for walks, in the hopes that we don&#x27;t know that you already went on one. your same commanding voice comes out when you ask for one. barks that sound less and less like barks, and more like you trying to enunciate something to us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235333068-eda23be0-cd53-4a23-9d0f-bbdaefdc2fab.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235333068-eda23be0-cd53-4a23-9d0f-bbdaefdc2fab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0262_2013-02-01 14 16 59 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we let you out back by the canal behind our house without a leash. you take these opportunities to see just how fast you can run unrestrained. when you achieve maximum speed, you hop like a rabbit in the grass. &quot;salta como un conejo&quot;, pa says. it&#x27;s with this hop that you hone in on a duck you see by the water. you chase him with all your might and jump straight into the canal after him. we&#x27;re scared for a moment, until we see you doggy paddling. after a moment, you give up on the duck and make a U-turn back to land. you&#x27;ve discovered your distaste for swimming, and from that day on, you dislike baths even more. speaking of baths, when you do take one, your giant mane sticks to your body. you look as bald as you ever do when you&#x27;re soaking wet. during baths, your little tongue constantly laps up the water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on walks, your mane flows in the wind. we remark how majestic you look at times. your gait has a signature trot, as if you&#x27;re skipping. you carry this trait for the rest of your life. mom says you walk like you think you&#x27;re a big dog. i think you know you&#x27;re big in your own way. when you meet dogs, you&#x27;re never scared -- instead, you&#x27;re curious. you don&#x27;t bark at them. your pointy tail wags like you&#x27;ve just discovered buried treasure. your ears perk up and your chest becomes more prominent when you want to greet them. you dance in circles around them, asking if they want to play. you will do this up until your very last day on this earth. just how you command us to walk further, you command us when you want to play with another dog or explore a patch of grass. it is your mission everyday to pee in more and more spots. you&#x27;ll stop dead in your tracks, and bury your nose in the grass for minutes at a time. sometimes we pull you away, but sometimes we give in and let you find the scent you&#x27;re looking for. you reserve your urine to make sure you cover more and more of the neighborhood each day. you&#x27;re actually very good at your job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes your surveying inspires you to dive into the grass, like you want to drench yourself in the smell of sun and leaves. you&#x27;ll roll around a few times until you&#x27;ve absorbed most of the heat from the warm grass. when you perk your head back up, you lay in the grass, squint and let your tongue hang out while you pant softly, &quot;keh keh keh&quot;. when you come back inside, the smell of the outdoors clings to you. in an effort to cool off, you&#x27;ll splay out all four of your legs so that your belly touches the cool floor. this technique becomes a Flitch staple™ and all dogs henceforth still owe you royalties.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it becomes clearer and clearer by the day who your favorite is. despite my brothers and i doing most of your caretaking, you always followed mom. when she would arrive home, you&#x27;d be at the door wagging your tail and hopping to touch her lap to let her know it&#x27;s time to pay attention to you. your attachment to her became a running joke; sometimes just to perk you up, i&#x27;d say &quot;mami?&quot; -- you&#x27;d know immediately what this means and jump up and run to the door expecting her. you&#x27;re so smart that you begin to recognize her car. many days, you spent hours sitting on rafael&#x27;s bed because it has the best access to the window by the door. you&#x27;ll poke your head between the blinds when you hear a car door shutting in the distance. from outside, she&#x27;ll see your head appear between the blinds, and then swiftly disappear as you storm off the bed and straight to the door.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if she came home before you came back from a walk, you would notice her car in the driveway from the distance and start running as fast as you can back home to jump in her arms. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;mi bebe&quot;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, she would call you. she took such joy in this, she would sometimes hide, and surprise you when you walked in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you would always follow her. if she walked to the kitchen, you&#x27;d follow. if she walked to the bedroom, you&#x27;d follow. if she got up from the bed, you&#x27;d jump off from beside her and follow. she would reference the Nintendo game my brother and I would play as kids, Pikmin, a game in which you have tiny plant creatures &quot;Pikmin&quot; follow you around. she would say you were like her little Pikmin. she quickly gives in to her motherly instinct and begins coddling you. you are always allowed to sleep on her bed, or any of our beds for that matter. you are always proud to claim your spot in our beds beside us. this becomes a detriment to pa who you often push out of bed, because you always want to nestle yourself between him and mom. even though it affects his quality of sleep, he never protests because he loves you too much. in fact, none of us ever protest. but when you&#x27;re not sleeping in our beds, you choose instead to stake out one of the dining room chairs. sometimes, they are pushed into under the table, and you relish in the secrecy of your personal bunker. you are found there frequently when we try to look for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after mom, pa is your next favorite, if only for the fact that when he arrives home, he immediately rewards you with a treat from the pantry. you always know his arrival means a treat from the pantry, so you&#x27;ll hop at him repeatedly as he marches over to the pantry to fulfill your request. when mom&#x27;s not home, you like sitting on mom and pa&#x27;s bed anyway while he works on the desk beside it. you become his company when he&#x27;s alone in the bedroom, sitting within arm&#x27;s reach at all times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after pa, there is rafael. your most loyal and attentive caretaker, and your best friend. you always knew to bark at him first when you wanted something. he&#x27;d sit at his computer, sometimes heavily focused on something, and you&#x27;d trot on over and demand your lunch or a walk. if it was time, he&#x27;d give it to you. if it wasn&#x27;t, he&#x27;d pick you up, and gently slam you on the bed as if to fight. he&#x27;d playfully jab at your belly and mouth, and you&#x27;d playfully retaliate by placing your teeth on his fists, but never biting. sometimes, i would hold you up and he would jab at you like we were ganging up on you. but you&#x27;d always win with a small kiss for him at the end, your tongue escaping your small mouth from the side. this is how you two would play, and you&#x27;d never stop playing like this. seeing you relax on his bed after a session of jabs and nibbles was a regular sight for me. even though i try to engage in this similar style of play with you, i&#x27;m never able to excite you on the same level as rafael. he becomes your most favorite and trusted playmate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;manny and i are never your favorite. we never mind. we love you all the same. it&#x27;s part of your personality, and you still command us when you wanna trick us into giving you extra walks or treats or to let you outside in the back patio.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at birthday parties, you always manage to find your way into the photos. less because you&#x27;re forcing yourself into them, and more because we&#x27;re forcing you into them. the center of the universe always manages to be a part of family gatherings and holidays.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and at meals, you sit at the table like a person. you never attempt to steal food from us. you sit patiently and watch us eat our meals. you do this everytime we have meals near you, even when the food is in your reach, you do not take it. we think you&#x27;re just very well-behaved. you prove us wrong one day when we leave doughnuts from dunkin donuts on the table. a doughnut goes missing. rafael notices you constantly walking in and out from under his bed. each time you walk out, you have your ears down as if guilty of a crime. rafael takes a peek underneath, and finds a doughnut. your &quot;dirty little secret&quot;. we laugh and it becomes one of your most famous and enduring acts of self-awareness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you&#x27;re not begging pa for treats, you beg everyone for bread or fruit. my dad calls you a &quot;panzon&quot; because you also have a taste for bread of all kinds; white, whole wheat, french, italian. you also seem to like to eat all fruits. when we peel a banana or orange, you&#x27;ll run from across the house, having picked up the scent. we regularly share our fruit with you. at first i think you&#x27;ll outgrow your taste for citrus, but you never do. you also go absolutely crazy for apples. rafael regularly shares his fruit with you. he still does to this day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some of my favorite memories are of the things I do to summon you. i could never hide a peanut butter jelly sandwich from you. i would be on the other side of the house making a pbj and quietly and secretly as i could. you would be behind closed doors sleeping on mom&#x27;s bed. i would cover it and sneak it into my bedroom, and close the door. no way you would detect it in your sleep and behind closed doors. then i would hear it -- scratching on mom&#x27;s door. you knew, and you were not giving up to get a piece. more often then not, i&#x27;d indulge you, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe that that was all i had to give, so i&#x27;d hold up my hands to your face until you seem satisfied there was no more. then you&#x27;d trot back to mom&#x27;s door and scratch it so i&#x27;d open it back up again. you would engage in this whole ceremony with rafael as well. outside of the scent of food, you&#x27;d also do the same thing if you ever hear me burp. i still do not understand what it was about me burping that riled you up so much.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since you first arrived to our home in late November, we begin to associate you with Christmas. in the cold winter months, we keep you warm with a small sweater adorned with a military theme. we call you Sgt. Flitch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one christmas, rafael gets a new Canon high quality camera from my father as a gift. he takes one of my favorite photos of you. mom asks for christmas themed photos of you so that she could make christmas cards using them. we lazily find a santa hat that is human-sized and place it on your head. it doesn&#x27;t fit so we have to keep readjusting it between photos. you are surprisingly patient throughout this whole process. the best photo is of you looking at the camera while the hat is falling off one ear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as the years go by, your dental health declines. a veterinarian informs us it&#x27;s typical of Chinese Crested dogs, of which you are descended. soon, you are missing most of your teeth except for the small ones in the front and your molars. your lack of teeth cause your tongue to regularly stick from the sides of your mouth. this becomes another trademark of your look. i see you sleeping on my bed while i study for a test next to you. i take a photo of you sleeping with your tongue sticking out; you open your eyes to look at me as i whisper your name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one morning in middle school, i end up missing the bus. mom and pa had already left home, and i don&#x27;t have a key to re-enter the house. i manage to jump over the fence and open my bedroom window which i had left unlocked. after barely managing to fit myself through the window, i land on my bed where you happen to be sitting. i begin crying at the stress of having ran to the bus stop only to miss it. you begin sniffing my face, and lick at my tears. i think you were more interested in the smell and salty flavor, but it&#x27;s comforting all the same, and i wrap my arms around you until you break loose. i lay next to you for a while before getting up to call mom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235376336-58029827-7e27-4f93-b737-580ce5cd419d.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235376336-58029827-7e27-4f93-b737-580ce5cd419d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;0175_Photo-0231 (2)&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we enter high school, and mom takes you to accompany her in the van while she drops us off at school. when we open the side door to exit the van and walk to class, you hop off to follow us. you then run to another student to say hi, jumping at their legs. i think they are shocked to see such a peculiar looking dog. but you&#x27;re also happy, and wagging your tail. we manage to pick you up and bring you back to mom. i think if you could, you would have told her about the new friend you made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my friends love you. iris regularly remarks how &quot;fucking cute&quot; you are when she pets you. armando loves to tease you and place things on your head. you manage to make it into a few of our home videos and dumb teenage projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one day as a teenager, i get a new web camera. i test it out by taking photos with you in my arms. the results are blurry and poorly lit. i love the photos all the same. they are of the few photos i ever have of you and i together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;years pass, and i go to live on my own for the first time at college. I experience an enduring depression but I don&#x27;t know what it is. I am immensely homesick and lonely. one day mom, pa, and rafael come to visit, and so do you. it is one of many roadtrips you will make. I&#x27;m not sure how well I hide it, but I am ecstatic and relieved to see you. I place you on my college bed and silently smile at how quickly you make yourself comfortable. I feel how much I love you more in that instant than I ever felt before then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eventually, the homesickness gets to me and i decide to transfer to a university near home so i can live with you and the family again. i make up some crap that i&#x27;m motivated to move back to save money, but that&#x27;s not the main reason. the main reason is i miss you and the family. when i return, you&#x27;re just as how i left you. maybe a little bit lazier, maybe a little bit more spoiled. you&#x27;re 6 years old now. how has time passed by like this? we take a photo of you next to our baby cousin Lynette, as you take interest in her ice cream cone. we take great amusement of telling Lynette that you are older than her by a few months. she has a hard time believing it. to be fair, most people have a hard time believing your age for most of your life; you&#x27;re always spritely and puppy-like. except for your little bald head, i guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 rolls by. manny has a baby. he moves away to a city he can afford to raise her. in the process, he leaves his own dog. your cousin Haku becomes your baby brother. on your first meeting, you are excited to meet him; you sniff him all around, wag your tail, and dance in circles around him. after the first few days, you come to accept him as part of the home -- even if he&#x27;s a little annoying sometimes. and you now have an extra companion on walks. we always walk the two of you together. despite his empty growls, Haku grows fond of you. it becomes clearer as the years go by that he cares about you. he keeps your spot on the sofa warm today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i resume my studies, this time living at home with you. i am much happier and fulfilled, and perform much better in my courses. i try computer science again after failing the year before when i lived alone, and i am able to pass my classes. maybe this is what i want to do after all. my relationship falls apart, but in the grand scheme of things, it seems like a minor loss. you are always home to remind us that everything is going to be OK.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eventually i graduate and get my first job out of college. i don&#x27;t move out and i don&#x27;t want to. i get to live at home with you still, and with Haku, mom, pa, and rafael. despite the occasional hardship or disagreement, we all live together as a happy family, with you as the gravitational pull that keeps us all together. every conversation somehow ends up being about you. every familial joke somehow ends up relating you. &quot;who&#x27;s going to take care of me when i&#x27;m older?&quot; my mom would ask when talking about nursing homes. &quot;well, flitch of course!&quot; we would answer, before she swept you up and sang her little song she had made up for when she cradled you -- &quot;do do dooko doo!&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&#x27;s 2015. one day we receive a letter in the mail from your veterinarian. it a reminder that you are 10 years old now, officially a senior dog. it&#x27;s recommended that you receive more frequent checkups and bloodwork. i stop to consider that for a minute. i see you cutely sleeping on the sofa with mom and pa. if this is retirement for you, you&#x27;re relishing it. you still love chasing toys around the coffee table and taking mom&#x27;s shoes out of her closet to chew on, just like you did as a pup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since you follow mom everywhere, of course you follow her into the garden. this becomes your secret pee spot in between walks. visiting the garden often meant finding your urine stains on the flower pots, or finding you or Haku in a crevice hunting lizards. you spend a lot of time sitting on the wooden bench while mom works in the garden. sometimes it&#x27;s sunny. your mane glows in the light when it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i took the photo below and an accompanying video when you spotted a lizard outside. this is just seconds before you jumped off the table and ran to the sliding glass door to catch him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i sit with you in the back patio. i begin taking photos of you. upon reviewing the photos, i start to notice the effects of age on you; you have discolored spots in your skin. the top of your head has more visible wrinkles from all the sunlight you get on. i start to feel sad at the thought that you are 10 years old, and consider the average lifespan of dogs. the sadness dissipates when i watch you perk up and run back inside when mom gets home. you appear as spry as i remember you as a pup. you maintain this spryness and peppiness for the rest of your life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one Sunday, rafael, iris and I are walking you and Haku in the neighborhood. we take the usual route leading to the pool and mailboxes. as we cross a street and enter a block corner, we notice a large dalmatian in the distance approaching us without a leash or an owner. we&#x27;ve only ever met friendly dogs in the neighbor and think nothing of it. the dog increases his speed and begins heading directly toward you. before we realize he is not friendly, he&#x27;s already trying to grab you, snarling and barking. you pull away but can&#x27;t get too far since I&#x27;m holding the leash. i try to pull you toward myself, but i can&#x27;t manage to get in between you and the attacking dog. Haku is barking. eventually the owner runs over, and that&#x27;s when we hear you howl. we are terrified. you stay silent afterwards, almost in a catatonic state. the owner takes his dog away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we didn&#x27;t know that you were in great pain or that your bladder had popped, or that you were going into renal failure. your first visit to the veterinarian suggests you are just in shock. i go to work the next day, but i&#x27;m shaken. rafael keeps me updated. he takes you to the back canal where you chased that duck into the water all those years ago. but you&#x27;re just still, and you won&#x27;t pee. finally rafael knows something is not right, and you go back to the veterinarian, this time an ER, and finally, they know what is wrong with you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i leave work. i&#x27;m driving to the animal hospital where you are. i expect the worst of news. i scream inside my car at the top of my lungs at the thought of you dying. tears are streaming down my face, and i hear a police siren behind me. i had been speeding. he pulls me over, and i put on a mask of composure that he probably could see through. he takes a look at my registration, and lets me go. when i arrive at the hospital, i&#x27;m mentally preparing myself for your death. i blame myself for not grabbing that dog or putting myself between you. it was not long ago i was contemplating your life -- 10 years old, a senior dog, is this it? is 10 years old a good long life? most dogs don&#x27;t make it past 10.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we are finally able to see you, you&#x27;re there with an IV in your arm. you look like you haven&#x27;t slept in days. before i can process anything the doctor says, i rush to your side to say how sorry i am for letting this happen to you. i kiss you and soon am able to make out the doctor is saying you will be OK.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you&#x27;re so happy to finally come home the next day. you adjust to the cone quickly. it soon becomes clear that you appear much sicker when you&#x27;re at the doctor&#x27;s office. at home, you&#x27;re yourself. weaker from the surgery that stitched up your bladder, but still demanding, spoiled, and hungry. you regain your appetite within a day, and you follow mom around, albeit a little slower this time. raf records a video of you vigorously eating an orange. you spend most of your recovery doing what you do best: sitting next to mom and pa on the sofa, and getting fed baby carrots and fruit. your perserverence pays off as it always does. you can cut through the worst of situations, endure the worst pain -- all you ever ask is that you come home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over the years, you give us a couple more medical scares. each time you are fine, and each time, you absolutely hate being in the veterinarians office. you shake in mom&#x27;s arms one time while waiting in the lobby. you know the smell and you know what you&#x27;re there for. you just want to go home.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235404165-0c62253b-bf3d-48e2-b9cf-87b874816981.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235404165-0c62253b-bf3d-48e2-b9cf-87b874816981.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img_20180903_200448&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you do. you spend most of your days at home doing what you love. you have a wonderful and beautiful life comfortable at home with your loving family.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i leave to work across the country for two years, knowing you are home safe and happy. looking back now, i wish i could have just stayed with you. i return in 2019, just in time for the pandemic. for a period of six months, i live back at home. i insist on having my bed be close to the floor. it is one of the best decisions i&#x27;ve ever made. on work days, i&#x27;ll turn my head to my right, and see you there, in the biggest most easily accessible bed you have in your old age.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i meet cindy, who will soon become your new doctor. we move in together, and i come to visit you every week. she helps remove a small mass we find on your side, and sends it to be tested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235397367-a593b1a2-469d-4cad-927f-b9ec6fd42303.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235397367-a593b1a2-469d-4cad-927f-b9ec6fd42303.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1613014441000&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mom calls us one morning. the mass came back as malignant. i hear mom&#x27;s voice leak from the phone as cindy talks to her and can tell she is crying. eventually, cindy recommends a specialist to have deeper margins removed to be extra safe. we all are concerned at the implications of you going under anesthesia now that you are over 15 years of age. but you are you after all, and you handle it like a champ. when you finally get home, you have some demands that must be met.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235399310-c000b11c-a90a-4fbe-85e2-fc507281462f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235399310-c000b11c-a90a-4fbe-85e2-fc507281462f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_20210327_101315&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i regularly contemplate your passing. i became influenced by some casual reading about Stoicism. apparently, contemplation of death helps with the eventual grieving process. despite that, I also regularly fantasize about you living to 20. we all knew of a dog in the neighborhood, Buddy, who was a friend of yours. Buddy lived to be 20 years old. by the end of his days, he was still taking walks, albeit completely blind. &quot;Flitch could surely beat Buddy&quot;, I would think. i obtain a false sense of security because my significant other is a veterinarian now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one work day, the idea of your mortality hits me especially hard. i tell myself that after work, i will visit for the sole purpose of just spending time to lay next to you. for some reason or another, i make an excuse that i&#x27;m too busy and end up not coming over that day. it is one of my greatest regrets in life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rafael takes many photos and videos of you in your old age. you look magnificient in every one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the day before Christmas, Armando brings his new dog, Nico, to come visit. you perk up as if you were 2 years old again. you perch yourself on the sofa, your tail wagging incessantly. i see you bend forward as if to engage in play. that evening is filled with you, Haku, and Nico circling around the living room. it is the best Christmas present in years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235403379-fe3cfb9d-e2ba-4760-9ad4-fae3fbcab6fa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235403379-fe3cfb9d-e2ba-4760-9ad4-fae3fbcab6fa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1221212157a_HDR&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#x27;m visiting in the new year, 2022, and you are in the back patio with mom. she picks you up and embraces you, kissing your small head. i decide to take a photo and i notice mom start to cry. it is the first real time i see her visibly contemplating that you will not be here forever with her. i take the photo as a replication of an earlier photo i took of you two, 14 years prior. i consider how old you are, and how much older mom looks too. i feel my heart beat and go to the bathroom afterwards, and sob silently for a minute. we still don&#x27;t know what will happen to you next month.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235403473-11f0268b-5d32-47ba-b712-e164f4cb9013.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235403473-11f0268b-5d32-47ba-b712-e164f4cb9013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220327_174654373&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have so many photos of you, but it never seems like enough. i&#x27;m always excited when family share a photo of you that i had never seen before. since you were born in 2005, many of your earlier photos are of lower resolution and poorer quality. this is before the age of smart phones, so they were taken with 4 megapixel dedicated digital cameras. i repeatedly silently wish that i had taken more photos of you as a puppy. i don&#x27;t think 13-year-old me had the right priorities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on monday, april 25, 2022, i receive a phone call. it&#x27;s rafael. i pick up and hear you screaming in the background. you are having a seizure, and my dad is cradling you thinking you are going to die in his arms. you probably wouldn&#x27;t have remembered any of it, but you must have been so confused when you came to. the specialist we take you to that night says it could be a fluke; after all, your bloodwork is perfect, your physique is extraordinary for a dog your age. the specialist sends us home. rafael and mom keep me updated that night. they send me a video, and you seem to be completely back to normal, waltzing around the kitchen, and asking for snacks. we remain hopeful that you will be OK, that maybe you will make it to 20 years old just like Buddy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuesday, you appear to be fine. you have the same aggressive sneeze you&#x27;ve had for the past two months, but otherwise, you are yourself. you walk with a pep in your step. you lick at your lips, and are excited to walk through the grass. you go on a short walk, but your walks have been shorter for a while now in your retirement. i&#x27;m relieved to know it may have just been a fluke.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we know it wasn&#x27;t. that night, you have two more seizures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235405669-b3018be1-466c-4289-ad67-2aa73805bb50.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235405669-b3018be1-466c-4289-ad67-2aa73805bb50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220426_200640809&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we spend the entire next day with you in the hospital. rafael refuses to leave your side. mom and pa take time off work to be with you for most of the day. i skip work completely to be there. they&#x27;ve put bells around your neck in the hopes that if you have another seizure, they would hear it. we know something serious is wrong. the shapes land in place when the doctor mentions a possible &quot;structural change in the brain.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we all take turns holding you, hugging you, and kissing you. rafael lays by your side and sings a song to you as you sleep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t care if the sun don&#x27;t shine
Or if it&#x27;s pouring down with rain
There&#x27;ll be a smile on my face
When I see you again&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235405820-bb5b5d58-d08c-481b-916e-51650c786305.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;4752973&amp;#x2F;235405820-bb5b5d58-d08c-481b-916e-51650c786305.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220427_170231766&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we walk you outside the clinic, and you&#x27;re incontinent. you actually have been partially for months, but we chalked it up to old age, just a normality, par for the course. the drugs that they gave you to repress the seizures are taking a toll on your body. you&#x27;re loopy and can barely walk without falling over. still you manage to mark your newfound territory. like i said before, you&#x27;re very good at your job.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235797826-99d6b21d-898f-4b9d-9c49-6f9bad9f88b8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235797826-99d6b21d-898f-4b9d-9c49-6f9bad9f88b8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220427_183740011&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next day, an MRI reveals what we feared the most. there is a structural change; a tumor had been swelling in your little skull for what could not have been a long time. when we hear the news, i feel the relief in knowing just what is wrong. it is shortly followed by the realization of what it all means. the doctor offers some options, none of which indicate you will be comfortable or yourself any longer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we take you home, the only place you ever want to be. we promise we won&#x27;t take you to a doctor again. you&#x27;ve always hated it, haven&#x27;t you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your favorite person in the whole world sits next to you as we drive home. there is no one in the car with dry eyes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235798798-9c238240-8bca-408f-9910-68d781f6eadd.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235798798-9c238240-8bca-408f-9910-68d781f6eadd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220428_174549257&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by now, you&#x27;ve deteriorated dramatically. all you want to do is rest, and you aren&#x27;t resting, you are restless. you cry loudly and inconsolably if we try holding you for too long. when you walk, you pace directionless and in circles. i wonder where you think you&#x27;re going. trying to keep you from walking into things or getting stuck proves to be a challenge. even now you&#x27;re strong as you ever were -- but it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re uncomfortable and confused. through all the tears, sobbing, and distress, Haku is anxious. he knows something is wrong with his brother. he doesn&#x27;t playfully bark at you like he usually does.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we spend the whole day with you, taking turns holding you, kissing you, and loving you, tending to your every need. you remember this, don&#x27;t you? some of your extended family even comes to visit. abuela, tia, lynette. she&#x27;s younger than you, remember? she&#x27;s already looking at colleges. you never needed to go to college though because you were always so smart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we buy you a doughnut from Dunkin Donuts. to our pleasant surprise, even now you can&#x27;t resist one -- you take some substantial nibbles from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cindy has agreed to help you transition to your next destination. you don&#x27;t have to leave your most favorite place in the world. home and in mami&#x27;s bed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before you leave, you want to go on another walk. this time with mom and rafael. it&#x27;s begun raining, but you march right through. you go for a long and sprawling walk, all the way up to the main road, back through the neighborhood, and to the backyard by the water where you almost caught that duck all those years ago. you even meet a new friend, a much younger and equally sized dog in the neighborhood. when you see him, you perk up, and your tail begins wagging, like it has since you were a pup. that&#x27;s how i know that through all the discomfort, crying, incontinence, and stress -- you were still yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235804290-6e8d0793-af46-4bdc-bb62-36e6e79224d1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235804290-6e8d0793-af46-4bdc-bb62-36e6e79224d1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220429_133435757&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the time comes for us to say goodbye, you&#x27;re already dozing off in mom&#x27;s bed. manny has made the 4 hour drive to be here with you and see you off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235804214-8297da46-7e05-40b5-ad02-4166a5e6f432.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235804214-8297da46-7e05-40b5-ad02-4166a5e6f432.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220429_124245246&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the five of us gather around to hold you, and kiss your small head, feet, and belly. you&#x27;re in your most favorite place in the whole world when cindy gives you the first shot that makes you go into a deeper sleep, your eyes barely opened, and your body easing up to the point where you look more comfortable than you have all week. we&#x27;ve all already said goodbye to you. i&#x27;ve already poured my heart out confessing my regrets, how much i&#x27;ve loved you, and how sorry i was for ever leaving your side. we stroke your head, your fur, and hold you in the ways we always have when we wanted to communicate &quot;i love you, Flitch&quot;. rafael holds his hand to your chest, feeling your heart beating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cindy gives you your second shot. and you keep sleeping, wrapped in your beautiful red blanket that was just for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then your heart stops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235810292-6d43281c-cd0c-4d95-9439-c11117d45a2f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&amp;#x2F;54276371&amp;#x2F;235810292-6d43281c-cd0c-4d95-9439-c11117d45a2f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PXL_20220429_232751736&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cindy carries you to her car, wrapped in your red blanket, and in your bed. we take turns saying goodbye to you, tucked in the bed in the passenger seat of the car. i have a hard time separating myself from you. &quot;just one more kiss goodbye&quot; in my head, over and over. but eventually we have to watch you be driven away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we walked back toward the house and the small field of grass behind it. looking out at the empty field where you would hop as a baby was a form a self-confirmation that you had raced passed the finish line ahead of us. and just as we do, the rain stops, and the clouds part. it&#x27;s sunny again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a piece of the picture&#x27;s bitten right out of the middle
I&#x27;m alone and thinner I feel
Is this a prayer?
Anaesthetise me just til you return
I feel the loss like a squandered opportunity to whisper
You&#x27;re all I ever needed&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a month after your passing, i&#x27;m on a cruise ship. at night, i step outside to watch the black water as the ship speeds home from the carribean. i look down at the water, barely illuminated by the moonlight. i consider for a moment that it doesn&#x27;t matter how far i go on this earth; if i plunged to the deepest bottoms of the ocean where no one has gone, i would not find you, and i can not bring you back. the futility of it shakes me. yet the thought that i would do anything to bring you back never leaves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a year passes. pa tells me that he and mom went to a wake the day before for an old work associate. to prepare for the event, mom looked in her closet for shoes, and picked up a pair. they had your bite marks on them. tiny indentations from your small front teeth, of the little teeth you had. mom sobbed, remembering how much you loved to play with her shoes. i began crying when i heard this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#x27;m writing this now a year later. i&#x27;m looking through a treasure trove of photos and videos we have of you, all the way back since you were a pup, recounting my memories of you, both painful and fond. when i go to your home, i see a lock of your hair that rafael saved of you. i see the little box with your ashes, resting on your favorite red blanket on the side table, and your bed underneath. i see the fruit that rafael leaves out for you everyday, that he shares with you just like he did when you were younger. I ask the questions that have burned since that day I took those photos of you in the back patio, in 2015:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Will the life we have with you outweigh the pain at the end? Will it be worth it?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is. everyday, every second.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if i could go back, and relive this life i&#x27;ve shared with you, knowing i couldn&#x27;t change anything, knowing the pain we&#x27;d endure, i would. without question.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;combing through these photos and memories of you reaffirmed something that pa told us the day before you passed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you came into our lives unsuspecting. but you molded us as much as we molded you. you left imprints in us just like you had on mom&#x27;s shoes. and the lasting impact of who you are -- are forever permanent, in us, in your home. i know that although the pain of missing you will never go away, neither will you. we repurpose that pain instead to celebrate the life of the most beautiful little soul we&#x27;ve ever known. and the way we speak of you today is the same way we&#x27;ve always spoken about you -- you find your way into the crevice of every conversation, every joke we make, and we see you when we look at the sofa, our beds, the dining room chairs, crumbs on the floors, indentations in the sheets -- just as you did when you found your way into the crevices of the closet, pulling out shoes, papers, trash, or rice we dropped on the floor. it is in your nature to be everywhere. you are the center of the universe, as you&#x27;ve always been since you came to us that day in 2005 -- a reference point to everything around us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: I now live on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keb.im&quot;&gt;keb.im&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vercel has finally retired their old &lt;code&gt;now.sh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; domains and have migrated all old apps to the new &lt;code&gt;vercel.app&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; domain. This was saddening to me, as I had used &lt;code&gt;keb.now.sh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for a couple years now and loved the tiny domain. &quot;keb dot vercel dot app&quot; does not quite have the same ring to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as I already own the &lt;code&gt;sheev.net&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; domain, I decided to ultimately move my site to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gitlab.com&#x2F;ee&#x2F;user&#x2F;project&#x2F;pages&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gitlab Pages&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, using a custom domain. I now live on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keb.sheev.net&quot;&gt;keb.sheev.net&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is cool because my main e-mail &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;code&gt;keb@sheev.net&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, I also explored several other static-site hosting services, and had fun playing around with build and deploy pipelines via Github Actions. From now on, this site has multiple mirrors:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keb.sheev.net&quot;&gt;keb.sheev.net&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seiken-densetsu-3-1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#seiken-densetsu-3-1996&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: seiken-densetsu-3-1996&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Seiken Densetsu 3 (1996)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, that was short lived. I will say that SD3 is a drastic improvement on its predecessor. However, after 10 hours, it&#x27;s hard to stay engaged. Similar to Secret of Mana, SD3 has a kind of pseudo real-time combat going on, and while it is improved, it is still woefully shallow. This game also has the worst menus I have ever seen. That said, it does have a killer soundtrack and easily the best visuals on the Super Nintendo.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;secret-of-mana&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#secret-of-mana&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: secret-of-mana&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Secret of Mana&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, this one has not aged well. While it is highly influential in the action RPG space, Secret of Mana&#x27;s script and plot leave much to be desired, characters are flat and uninteresting, dungeons are boring, and combat pretends to be real-time while feeling unresponsive and unsatisfying, with hit boxes that are unpredictable across enemy types. Since dropping this game, I have started its sequel (Seiken Densetsu 3) and it is already far above an improvement in every regard.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;illusion-of-gaia&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#illusion-of-gaia&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: illusion-of-gaia&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Illusion of Gaia&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tremendously &lt;em&gt;mid&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; action RPG. Think Zelda, but with light RPG elements, and a non-sensical plot. Unfortunately even with some legitimately challenging boss fights, the dungeons here are boring, some puzzles are downright nebulous, and the English translation ranges from kinda cute to downright awful. A very mixed bag overall. Second in the unofficial Quintet trilogy. I&#x27;d say skip this one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;crown-trick&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#crown-trick&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: crown-trick&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Crown Trick&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By no means a bad game, but not astounding either. Graphics are mobile game quality, but good overall. A modern but average dungeon crawler.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;river-city-girls&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#river-city-girls&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: river-city-girls&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;River City Girls&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like beat-em-ups. I even liked the original River City Ransom. Something about its simplicity made it enjoyable. For some reason, I can&#x27;t get into this game. The humor itself is not very funny, although it is bearable. The main problem are the controls which can&#x27;t be remapped, and responsiveness of the playable characters. Somehow in a game centered around 2D fighting, combat is stiff and not fun.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 cents on Steam when on sale. A very straightforward shmup that probably has more in common with Galaga than Ikaruga. Visually, get ready for harsh tones of black and white. There isn&#x27;t great visual feedback of when your bullets hit enemies. Shooting asteroids results in this weird sprite jitter. Not terrible, but not good.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;refunct&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#refunct&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: refunct&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Refunct&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very casual, easy-going first-person puzzle platformer. Not bad by any means, but not attention grabbing either.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recore&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#recore&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: recore&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ReCore&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thoroughly mediocre experience directed and designed by some of the minds behind the hailed Metroid Prime trilogy. I&#x27;m not sure what happened here -- there are good ideas that are half-implemented all over the place. Production values are also wildly inconsistent. The main character is about as bland and generic as they come for video games. My only guess is that they ran out of budget and time. It&#x27;s strange; ReCore is not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but it&#x27;s very &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Might revisit in the future, but not looking forward to it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ganpuru-gunman-s-proof&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#ganpuru-gunman-s-proof&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ganpuru-gunman-s-proof&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Ganpuru: Gunman&#x27;s Proof&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ganpuru is a game released late in the Super Famicom&#x27;s lifespan. A Japan-only game, Ganpuru&#x27;s visuals draw heavily from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. And by &quot;heavily&quot; I mean it straight rips off the visuals from Zelda. Despite it&#x27;s Zelda-esque appearance, Ganpuru actually plays very little like Zelda&#x27;s RPG-lite gameplay, and instead feels more like a retro twin-stick shooter. My issue with Ganpuru is its minimal gameplay loop is stretched ridiculously thin. By the second dungeon, the game already feels stale, despite it introducing more weapons for the player to use. Despite its shortcomings, Ganpuru seems like a game designed and targeted toward children, and that&#x27;s likely the audience that would enjoy this game the most.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;skygunner&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#skygunner&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: skygunner&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Skygunner&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skygunner is a difficult game to place... and a difficult game in general. Underneath its bad anime art and cutesy exterior lies a deceivingly complex game where your performance is better measured by the amount of &quot;cash&quot; you obtain by the end of a mission, rather than if you completed the mission at all -- infact, completing missions is not the challenge here. Cash is essentially your score for a given mission, which can be increased further by multipliers which can be obtained by completing objectives quicker, and dispatching enemy fighters with missile chains. The catch is that every use of a weapon &lt;em&gt;lowers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; your overall cash, so you must be conservative with how often you fire your weapons. The result of all of this is a bipolar difficulty curve and controls that betray your best interests -- Skygunner demands that you be precise, but in an effort to be accessible, gives the player a glossy, over-simplified control scheme. There&#x27;s a brilliant game in here somewhere, but it will take the time and patience of a high-score chaser or an aerial combat enthusiast to find.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tobe-s-vertical-adventure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tobe-s-vertical-adventure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tobe-s-vertical-adventure&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Tobe&#x27;s Vertical Adventure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cute indie puzzle platformer with good pixelart, grating music, and bad controls. Would make an ideal mobile game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shelter-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#shelter-2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: shelter-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Shelter 2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelter 2 is a game that is needlessly open-world with half-baked, barely functioning mechanics that can&#x27;t hold the weight of an ultimately meaningless gameplay loop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;haunted-ps1-demo-disc-2020&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#haunted-ps1-demo-disc-2020&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: haunted-ps1-demo-disc-2020&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Haunted PS1 Demo Disc 2020&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection of mostly short, mostly surreal, mostly walking simulator horror indie games from itch. Some gems (Neko Yume, Tasty Ramen), but it&#x27;s hard to have patience for generic horror games that are even sometimes completely broken. Still, the concept and the effort is admirable. I&#x27;d like to see more &quot;demo disc&quot; releases in the future.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;night-in-the-woods&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#night-in-the-woods&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: night-in-the-woods&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Night In The Woods&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A game with fantastic visuals, animation, and music that places more emphasis on its narrative and (unfortunately) uninteresting characters than its gameplay, which is practically non-existent at least for the first couple hours of playtime. The humor of this game regularly falls flat and can be called anything but timeless -- much of it is equivalent to the quirky randomness you&#x27;d probably encounter everyday from browsing your Twitter feed. Like many from this era of narrative-driven indie games, you&#x27;re probably better off watching a YouTube walkthrough. Or skip altogether.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (11&#x2F;09&#x2F;2025) - Nintendo&#x27;s prized second-party developer, Retro Studios, takes over the reigns from Nintendo&#x27;s former prized second-party dev (Rare), and delivers the best 2D Donkey Kong game in 14 years, reinventing Nintendo&#x27;s beloved franchise while remaining faithful to the SNES originals. DKCR is pure platforming fun, with top-tier animation work and level design which have aged incredibly 15 years after release. While the music isn&#x27;t as great as David Wise&#x27;s iconic soundtracks, what&#x27;s here pays homage with plenty of tunes being remixes of DKC tracks. DKCR&#x27;s difficulty does walk a fine line between genuine, satisfying challenge, and straight up bullshit -- you&#x27;ll read plenty online about the rocket barrel and K levels. Not to mention some of the floaty controls which take time to get used to. Otherwise, what&#x27;s here is a supremely polished game that proves Retro Studios is one of the most versatile developers in the business.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;metroid-prime-3-corruption&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#metroid-prime-3-corruption&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: metroid-prime-3-corruption&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (10&#x2F;29&#x2F;2025) - Well, I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to playing this two years after completing Metroid Prime 2, and I have to say, Corruption is a mixed bag. It&#x27;s clear Nintendo and Retro Studios were trying to cash in on Metroid&#x27;s reputation as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;mature&quot;, action-oriented franchise to compete against the likes of other shooters in the seventh generation. Corruption has voice-acting (a series first), a higher emphasis on combat, and a more linear game structure. All of this is exemplified by an intro sequence that&#x27;s clearly inspired by shooters like Halo and Half-Life. Unfortunately, these influences weirdly conflict with the emergent, solitary exploration that Metroid is known for. Instead of one large interconnected map, Corruption is composed of several smaller planets that you hop between using your ship via unskippable cutscenes. While exploration is still central to the gameplay, and the game mostly seems to shed its seventh-generation stylings a couple hours in, Corruption &lt;em&gt;does&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; throw one too many bullet sponge enemies your way, perhaps as a way to upsell the Wii&#x27;s motion control gimmicks. Regardless, Corruption is still a good time, and features Metroid&#x27;s best visuals to date, with some really impressive boss sequences especially in the last section of the game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-fantasy-tactics&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#final-fantasy-tactics&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: final-fantasy-tactics&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (10&#x2F;23&#x2F;2025) - The tactical role-playing game by which all tactical role-playing games are judged by. One of the best written stories in video games. Originally released in 1997, this game is nearly 30 years old, but its jobs system provides so much depth and replayability that obvious why this game has such a strong following all these years later. The plot is driven by themes of betrayal, class struggle, and the distortions of history that arise when we celebrate the dead. A cast of distinct and complex characters drive the narrative, and each story beat carries a hard hitting revelation or development. The bittersweet ending provides satisfying closure, with a final scene that punctuates this cautionary tale with signs that tragedy is neverending in Ivalice. Beating the game left me wanting to start a New Game+ right away. I played the PS1 version using The Lion War of the Lions patch which includes features and the improved (imo) translation from the PSP version. By the way, the soundtrack is top 5 of all time. Matsuno&#x2F;Sakimoto have done it again. Can&#x27;t wait to replay this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-takes-two&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-takes-two&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-takes-two&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;It Takes Two&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (08&#x2F;21&#x2F;2025) - Another Josef Fares game with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay. It Takes Two is designed to be played by two people, ideally sitting next to each other in split-screen mode. At it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s a 3D platformer adventure game, with linear levels, scripted action sequences, and puzzle-solving that relies on a pendulum of problem solving between each player. What&#x27;s here is executed surprisingly well considering Hazelight&#x27;s last clunky experience (A Way Out); platforming is satisfying, each character is responsive to control and visually distinct. The visuals are colorful and highly detailed, with environments that delight the senses with bountiful amounts of interaction and minigames interspersed throughout. Boss fights can be surprisingly challenging, sometimes bookending a mostly leisurely level with a tremendous difficulty spike. Fortunately, you have infinite continues, which made this game very accessible to my wife, with whom I played through the game with. The linearity of this game makes sense given the highly tailored experience, however, it does mean there is little replay value. Overall, I thought this was a great time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (07&#x2F;23&#x2F;2025) - A spiritual successor to A Link to the Past, which is one of my most favorite games of all time. While not as impactful as the original, ALBW is as faithful a modernization of 2D Zelda can get, and delivers a high quality Zelda experience in a handheld form factor. Despite this being a handheld game, it feels like Nintendo cut no corners here -- dungeons are intricate and thoughtfully designed; the world map which is mostly inspired A Link to the Past is large and littered with secrets; and the music and visuals are incredible for a 3DS game. It&#x27;s really quite impressive how good this game looks running at 60FPS on the 3DS, with detailed character animations, atmospheric shader effects, and elaborate cinematic cutscenes. My only criticism is that on the default difficulty, bosses are far too easy, and this is compounded by the new item shop system wherein you can rent all items in the game upfront. Regardless, it&#x27;s hard not to recommend this if you like classic Zelda.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Slay the Princess — The Pristine Cut&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (05&#x2F;11&#x2F;2025) - A deeply satisfying horror-themed visual novel that juggles psychological and metaphysical concepts in fun ways. The music, art, and writing form an experience that is both absurdly humorous and emotionally exhausting. Regardless of your taste in games, I highly recommend at least a playthrough (~5 hrs) of Slay the Princess -- chances are if you don&#x27;t enjoy the overarching narrative, you&#x27;ll at least get a kick out of one of the many branching story paths.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;super-metroid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#super-metroid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: super-metroid&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Super Metroid&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (03&#x2F;28&#x2F;2025) - I played this game in bits and pieces as a kid, but never played through it to completion until now. Super Metroid casts a large shadow as one of two cornerstones that defined the &quot;Metroidvania&quot; subgenre (along with Symphony of the Night). It&#x27;s still a fantastic game 31 years later, its only downsides being an aging control scheme and a few frustrating backtracking excursions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;person-4-golden-pc&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#person-4-golden-pc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: person-4-golden-pc&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Person 4 Golden (PC)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (03&#x2F;21&#x2F;2025) - I originally played Persona 3 FES way back in 2008. Playing Persona 4, I could see this as more of an incremental upgrade over the previous game. The mechanics, social link system, assets, and gameplay loop are virtually the same. Which is good and bad -- P3 and P4 both feature what is mostly bog standard turn based RPG combat which sometimes descends into grind territory. The appeal here are the persona-fusions, which entail experimenting by combining multiple personas to create new&#x2F;rare personas; and the social link system, which also features a dating sim aspect. Persona 4 features excellently written characters and a fun Scooby-Doo like murder mystery where a bunch of high school kids try to gather clues to find the killer. There are enough clues for you to deduce the killer on your own before the game reveals them for you, which is a nice touch. This is a very cozy game to play, and each social link character is lovable for different reasons.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (03&#x2F;04&#x2F;2025) - Fun as heck puzzle-platformer with unique and responsive jumping mechanics in 1994. Charming visuals, decent music, and plenty of content with 98+ levels. The great reveal after completing the first 5 levels is brilliant.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (01&#x2F;17&#x2F;2025) - A fantastic game with a sweeping globe-trotting story, unique and likable characters, amazing visuals, music, fun action combat paired with surprisingly deep RPG mechanics and varied upgrade system -- frustratingly held back by some ridiculous design decisions that rear their ugly heads constantly. Why do enemies cause damage upon death? What&#x27;s with the insane difficulty spikes? Why do you have to individually step through locations one-by-one on maps? What&#x27;s with the tedious maze levels? Why do only certain shops carry certain items, thus forcing you to painstakingly exit a map, to enter another one just to buy one item? Why is the only way to exit a stage to go ALL the way back to the beginning? Why can some missions only be completed if you equipped a very specific weapon that the game never indicates &lt;em&gt;even exists&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? Anyway, that was a lot of criticism for a game that I actually love and thoroughly enjoyed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (12&#x2F;11&#x2F;2024) - The pinnacle of 3D Mario continued. Imagine Super Mario Galaxy with none of the fluff, and firing on all cylinders. Nintendo EAD basically stuffed all of their crazy ideas into one game that focuses on being the most pure 3D Mario experience imaginable. The result is even better than the original. Not sure what else to say, it&#x27;s a perfect 3D platformer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (11&#x2F;11&#x2F;2024) - A minimal yet focused Metroidvania with heavy emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving. Animal Well sports a unique retro visual style that juxtaposes simple pixel art with lush and high detailed environments. The lone developer made great use of shaders; watch as animated light sources cast shadows across the player character and the environment, or how translucent streams of water distort objects behind them. Not to mention an included CRT shader that&#x27;s enabled by default! Animal Well reminds me of Portal in that its bountiful puzzles are so cleverly designed, that you end up feeling smart for solving them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (10&#x2F;04&#x2F;2024) - Is this the pinnacle of 3D Mario? I&#x27;m not sure, but damn is this game good. Platforming is centered around the unique concept of orbital planets. As Mario, you can freely walk on these planets which all have their own gravitation pull, meaning you can walk sideways, upside down, and even jump from one planet&#x27;s orbit to another. It was a risky idea considering how it can result in confusing input, but somehow the team at Nintendo pulled it off with finesse. The result is possibly the most unique 3D platformer ever made; some levels have you long jumping right off the edge of a planet and being pulled in by the gravitational force of another, before being launched across the map like a missile. Again, Nintendo shows that they&#x27;re at the top of their craft when it comes to controls and gameplay polish. New mechanics are effortlessly introduced throughout the game, each one good enough that it can be its own video game. The soundtrack, while mostly MIDI, contains some instantly memorable soaring orchestral tracks that you will take to your grave. It&#x27;s hard to believe that this game is 17 years old at this point -- if it came out today, people would still hail it as a revolutionary 3D platformer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (09&#x2F;24&#x2F;2024) - Much like the sequel, Sparkster is a frenetic, brutally difficult, and cinematic arcade-like action adventure game. This time, Sparkster&#x27;s rocket abilities are usable with a single button press instead of having to hold down the attack button, making the game a lot more faster paced. Additionally, Sparkster adds weapon bonuses, a nifty slot machine system, and multiple endings (I was not good enough to unlock the &quot;true&quot; ending, although the difference is minor).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (09&#x2F;21&#x2F;2024) - Very charming Genesis&#x2F;Megadrive arcade style platformer. The spritework here stands out even if it looks a bit dated. The levels, bosses, and backdrops are all inventive; you can tell the designers were having fun with it. The game is very short (2h) but also brutally difficult.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (09&#x2F;17&#x2F;2024) - An overall enjoyable platformer. Does not live up to the same quality as the previous two titles, but scratches the itch if you wanted more after Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest. This game does feature an open map that lets you tackle worlds&#x2F;levels in whatever order you choose. Additionally, there are much more minigames and hidden secrets here than previous games. Bosses are &quot;OK&quot; at best in my opinion -- many are tedious slogs with funky (kong) hit detection. The soundtrack is OK, but doesn&#x27;t match the grand cinematic or ethereal quality of David Wise compositions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (09&#x2F;02&#x2F;2024) - A heartfelt story blending themes of existentialism, environmentalism, fate, and duality into an epic action RPG tale with combat that still mostly holds up ~29 years later. The translation is a bit all over the place, with obvious Western colloquialisms here and there, but overall the heavy-hitting emotional moments are still effective. Magic is never explained and is practically useless except for a few spells that provide QoL improvements. A few bosses are downright BS without grinding unfortunately, and this is made more infuriating by the games&#x27; funky hitboxes and unforgiving recovery time upon damage. Terranigma also has a series of fun townbuilding sidequests which make sense given this is a Quintet game (of ActRaiser fame). But whatever you do, &lt;strong&gt;don&#x27;t vote for Louis&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Sometimes progression can seem a bit obtuse, which was not rare in this era of Nintendo Power and exchanging tips with school friends. Overall, I really liked this game -- there are several tender moments that are rare to see in games even today, and the gameplay, while flawed, is still solid. Fantastic spritework and sprite animation, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VhcmVmu34ss&amp;amp;r=f&quot;&gt;killer soundtrack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; also help carry the whole experience. I recommend Terranigma if you are at all interested in RPGs of this era.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (08&#x2F;11&#x2F;2024) - Bit of a weird one to rate and that would probably be of no surprise to Earthbound&#x2F;Mother fans. This is another one of those &quot;you had to be there&quot; kind of games from what I can tell. In some ways, Earthbound is the first &quot;post-modern&quot; RPG, not in the sense that it has anything to do with the social&#x2F;artistic movement of modernism, but in that it defied the constructs of both RPGs and videogames, and many conventions that gamers had come to expect to be omnipresent are turned on their heads here. Often it&#x27;s for the sake of making fun of the medium. But even more often, Earthbound wants to make fun of &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. But not in an irreverent or snideful kinda way; because Earthbound is also 100% sincere in its themes of friendship and banding together with weirdos or eccentric people to stop a malevolent metaphysical force that threatens existence. I think the designers just want the player to always be aware that they are playing a videogame (which makes sense given all the 4th wall breaks) -- immersion is not really important. After saying all of this, it may surprise you to find out Earthbound is a Dragon Quest-like turn-based RPG. Its most unique feature that&#x27;s worth replicating in traditional videogames is probably it&#x27;s rolling health meter which brings about a sense of urgency and timing strategies not usually seen in turn-based RPGs. But anyways, it&#x27;s extremely charming. The writing is laugh-out-loud funny at times, the cast is lovable and distinct, the visuals range from basic to psychedelic, and the soundtrack is top 10 on SNES. Before you play the hundreds of games that were influenced by or ripped off Earthbound (like the awful YIIK: Postmodern RPG or w&#x2F;e it&#x27;s called), just play this first. P.S. I highly recommend the Maternalbound Redux for balancing fixes, uncensoring, and the infinitely valuable RUN button.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (06&#x2F;09&#x2F;2024) - One of the most imaginative games I&#x27;ve ever played. Each world is a theme park filled to the brim with interesting platformer puzzle sections, challenges, and hidden rewards. The visuals, while a little held back by the Switch&#x27;s hardware, are fluid, colorful, detailed, and lovingly animated. The soundtrack here is fully orchestrated and varied enough that it never gets uninteresting -- the game even includes a built-in music player so you can listen to whatever track you want no matter what level you&#x27;re on (highly recommend the Forgotten Isle track; it has an odd time signature!). While Mario can be a little slippery at times, the controls are otherwise watertight, and coupled with Mario&#x27;s new abilities, they give 3D Mario some of the most dynamic and creative platforming you can think of in a video game. Remember what Breath of the Wild did for open-world games? Odyssey does that for 3D platforming. This game also features tons of nostalgic fan-service that is never overbearing, and often sentimental. But anyways, I can go on and on. This game is near-perfect, amazingly well balanced, has an incredibly high skill ceiling while being welcoming to newcomers as well, and just chock full of GOOD content etc etc. You ever play a game that is clearly unfinished and half-assed? Think Ubisoft trash, or over-hyped early access shit; well, this game is the exact opposite of that. It&#x27;s a masterwork of the craft. Go play it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (03&#x2F;07&#x2F;2024) - The closest I&#x27;ll ever get to being an actual time detective. And also 19th century insurance inspector for the East India Trading Company. Another game by Papers Please creator, Lucas Pope, Obra Dinn is essentially one game-long deduction puzzle wherein you must discover what happened to everyone aboard the ill-fated Obra Dinn. You do this using a magical pocketwatch that, when used on the remains of the deceased, will trigger a flashback to the moment they died. As you go along finding more bodies, it&#x27;s your job as the inspector to deduce and record who is who, and how they died. The meat of the game is carefully dissecting these moments frozen in time, looking for clues that will aid in revealing identities of the parties involved. Sometimes you can do this by association and accents (some crewmembers are Russian, others Chinese or English), by affiliation, process of elimination, or simply guesswork. Eitherway, the game is incredibly engaging and I had a great time going back and reviewing events multiple times to see if I had missed anything. If there&#x27;s anything bad I can say about Obra Dinn it&#x27;s: having to physically walk up and down floors to re-watch events is very tedious; there are a few very deliberately placed red herrings; the ending is a bit of a let down, and I wish some of the motives were more fleshed out.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (02&#x2F;03&#x2F;2024) - A pretty good open-world adventure game that gives fans the Spider-Man game they&#x27;ve always wanted. By now you&#x27;ve heard how much fun it is to swing around the city in this game -- indeed, it&#x27;s pretty fluid and amazing how good of a job Insomniac did in making traversal enjoyable in this game. Combat is similar to the Arkham games, although much more interesting thanks to the gadgets which remind me a lot of Insomniac&#x27;s other games with weapon wheels like Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank or Resistance. The story is decent and features several classic Spider-Man villains like Doc Ock, Electro, Hammerhead, etc. Some great acting chops on the mocap and voice actor of Doc Ock. While this game does a lot of things right, it unfortunately is not greater than the sum of its parts. Too many missions are tiring &quot;beat-up-50-baddies&quot; setups bookended by cutscenes. The MJ levels that are supposed to provide a reprieve from the constant button mashing end up being entirely boring. The detective missions that have Spider-Man following an invisible trail are also a drag. The collectathons and endless copy-pasted missions are also not interesting enough to incentivize the player to do. Overall though, this was a good experience and an extremely polished game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (10&#x2F;08&#x2F;2023) - Metroid Prime, but more refined. In almost every technical aspect, this is better than the original. The visuals have aged incredibly well. Environments are impeccably designed with little details scattered throughout. Retro also liberally used bump maps throughout, which normally look like crap after being scaled to high def resolutions, but actually look pretty tasteful here (running on Dolphin at 1080p). Sound design and soundtrack as usual are fantastic; the main theme is probably the best theme on the GameCube. Prime 2&#x27;s biggest weakness is, again, the backtracking. Somehow it is worse in this one than the original due to the dark&#x2F;light world mechanic. Get ready to see the unskippable cutscene of Samus transporting herself to the dark&#x2F;light world at least a hundred times (which I understand on GC, this was a hidden loading screen). Hunting for the Sky Temple keys was probably the biggest F.U. to everyone who ever complained about backtracking.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - The first time I saw Cuphead, I was like &quot;ok this just looks like a bog standard 2D run n gun like megaman or one of the million that released on Super Nintendo 30 years ago&quot;. And to some degree, that is true. Gameplay wise, Cuphead isn&#x27;t anything special. What makes Cuphead so special is its fine tuned difficulty. And of course the visuals. But mostly, Cuphead is a lesson in boss design. The game is certainly beatable by the average video gamer, even if it seems impossible at times.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (08&#x2F;07&#x2F;2023) - I don&#x27;t know where to start. This is one of the worst games I have ever played. I&#x27;ve played plenty of technically incompetent games that were bad, but Borderlands 3 is more offensive because it is actually technically &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and it was clearly very expensive to produce. It feels like a game designed by committee. It completely fails at being engaging, the script very well could have been written by ChatGPT with a prompt like &quot;write me a video game that appeals to millenials&quot;, the gameplay is braindead tedium, every firefight has zero stakes, guns are boring to shoot, 99% of items are useless, quests are the same dumb &quot;kill 3 goons&quot; that were boring in 2004 when you first played them in WoW, &lt;em&gt;none&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the characters are likeable, and the visuals somehow look like a late generation PS3 game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (06&#x2F;12&#x2F;2023) - When this remake was announced, my first reaction was &quot;that game doesn&#x27;t need a remake.&quot; I still stand by that. But is this remake actually good? The answer is, &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Is it better than the original? Absolutely not, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, it doesn&#x27;t matter because this is an entirely different game, so playing one does not equate playing the other. RE4 Remake is more deliberately paced, with a greater focus on realism, a less comic tone, and weightier combat. Most of the silliness of the original is absent here (no laser dodge sequence, no Indiana Jones boulder chase, Salazar is notably more muted), although Leon still has a few cheesy quips and the merchant is as charming as the original. Combat has been rebalanced to be more of a tug-of-war; your knife can be used to parry, but now it breaks; melee is not as exploitable, and ammo is now scarce, but you can collect resources to craft items&#x2F;ammo. The end result is a game that feels significantly more survival-horror than the original. Visually, Capcom is at the top of their game here. The voice cast is all stellar with the exception of Saddler and Ada&#x27;s unfortunate recast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (05&#x2F;20&#x2F;2023) - GameCube&#x27;s flagship &quot;first-person adventure&quot;, this was the Metroid&#x27;s series first foray into the 3rd dimension. Against all odds, a small studio in Austin, Texas pulled off the first translation of a Metroidvania to 3D, and they boldly chose to make it in first-person. Anyways, it paid off. Exploring Tallon IV in 2023 is still one of the more atmospheric things you can do in a videogame. I played this via Primehack, and the game is vastly improved by mouse+keyboard controls. Still, lock-on is essential for dodging and also focusing in on impossibly tiny enemies. The graphics somehow &lt;em&gt;still&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; hold up even after 21 years, a testament to good art design and the technical skill of the folks at Retro Studios (and also to the Unreal Engine 2). I subtract one point for the backtracking which gets tiring quickly. Also, don&#x27;t play on Hard&#x2F;Hypermode, it&#x27;s just tedious.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (05&#x2F;11&#x2F;2023) - The legendary and slightly overhyped JRPG that set the standard (along with FFVI) for enormous, character driven role-playing adventures. I think Chrono Trigger is a very &quot;you had to be there&quot; kind of game. Regardless, it has aged like fine wine, and introduced or refined a lot of concepts that we now take for granted in modern RPGs. Side quests, multiple endings, lack of random encounters, active time based combat, and an unheard of time travel mechanic. The latter of which makes for some clever quest design, and also gives way to some very emotional moments (which one of us can truly say they wouldn&#x27;t want to change something in the past?). All of the characters are diverse and lovable, and have their own dedicated side-quests as well that develops them further. I&#x27;m giving this game a 4, but it can easily be a 5 with another playthrough. Stop reading this and give it a shot. By the way, the soundtrack is top 5 on the SNES.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

SIGNALIS combines the best parts of Silent Hill and Resident Evil to create a tense and often unforgiving gameplay loop of resource management, exploration, and puzzle solving. Some of the best puzzles I&#x27;ve seen in a game, survival horror or not. The soundtrack is a top-notch Yamaoka-inspired ambient landscape with a harsh cyberpunk edge. The visuals are a fifth-generation throw back, complete with jaggies and an optional CRT mode; however, it never looks dated, and the developer did an amazing job of applying post-procesing and lighting effects to seemingly 2D objects. Story-wise, SIGNALIS is known for being a mind-melting existentialist thriller&#x2F;love story. Sometimes the writing comes off as a bit heavy-handed, but there&#x27;s enough rich world building, intrigue, and heart in all the ambiguity to keep it compelling for the entire playthrough (which is meaty at over 10 hours).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Imagine minimal Syphony of the Night with far less loot and no equippable items. Most of the magic in this game is in the form of &quot;DSS&quot; Cards, which are cards that are randomly dropped. Combining two cards allows for a variety of abilities that consume MP. The map design in CotM is very basic, and the bosses range from easy to straight up bullshit. (Un)fortunately, bosses are easy to cheese, especially with summons. Potion droprate is hilariously low -- prepare to grind for MP potions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Ironically, RE7 was seen as a return to roots for the franchise, and here we are doing a return to roots of RE4-era Resident Evil. That is to say, there are still strong hints and stretches of survival horror gameplay (think scarce ammo, one-shot enemies, creepy corridors, puzzle-solving, haunting ambiance, etc) but a bulk of the time is spent crafting and shooting at hordes of enemies. Speaking of, enemy variety is much more improved from 7, and certainly more creative (no spoilers). The Duke is a goofier version of the merchant of RE4. Production-wise, it&#x27;s hard to say RE has ever looked this good; character models border on photorealistic without entering uncanny valley, and the audio design rivals the best parts of REmake.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

To start, RE7 gives in to many of the survival horror tropes that became popular during the 2010s -- annoyingly dark camera, scripted first-person sequences, plenty of post-processing effects including the cliche VHS camera treatment, and to top it off, an awfully monotone color palette. I haven&#x27;t seen a game this brown since PS3. Bosses have interesting designs, but often end in long scripted sequences. Enemy variety is also virtually non-existent. On a positive note, the RE formula was actually very well translated to the change in perspective. The areas are mostly open and free to explore. Hidden items are everywhere and are actually possible to find using some in-game powerups. Voice acting and character animation are solid throughout, although the dialogue is at times non-sensical, and the plot is reduced to &quot;evil demon child&quot; by the game&#x27;s midpoint. Also, Zoe&#x27;s accent is terrible. RE7 also rides this strange uncanny line between highly reaslitic and cartoony, and this is made even more apparent in the DLC (wherein you can PUNCH enemies to hell, which, btw, is a lot of fun).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

One criticism I do have is to allow players to use typewriters for saving on difficulties lower than Hardcore. Even then, I highly recommend playing this game on Hardcore mode for a more authentic experience. Visuals, voice-acting, and sound are some of the best I&#x27;ve seen in a video game to date.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Impressive visuals (for the time) that finally bring &lt;em&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; SEGA arcade-quality graphics to the RE series. Code Veronica is the first RE game to feature fully 3D-rendered environments. While I&#x27;m a big fan of the beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds of previous titles, I think the dynamic camera is definitely an improvement. This is the final Resident Evil game to feature pure, tank-controls RE gameplay. After CV, the series becomes even more action oriented. Still a few jumpscares here and there; environments are varied enough to not make backtracking too awful. Like RE3, one of the more average of the series. Bosses are almost non-existent and the ones that are there are boring.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

The most noteworthy additions to the formula are the branching paths (although they are pretty superficial) and the dodge mechanic (which is often unreliable). Nemesis creates an interesting and nerve-wracking dynamic because he is the first RE enemy that can follow you past zones. Content-wise, this game is slim. The sections with Carlos were far too short and samey. Overall -- play it if you&#x27;re really dying for some more RE action.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Controls are floaty and imprecise; Henry often slides or turns awkwardly, and the auto lockon frequently has you pointing in unintended directions. Most of the items&#x2F;weapons are completely useless -- in fact, the best way to play this game is to completely avoid all combat despite the designers regularly packing corridors with hordes of enemies. Aside from the garbage combat, Silent Hill 4 has some real nice visuals that have aged quite well. Some stunning art direction and genuinely spooky imagery. Sound design as usual for this series is impeccable (aside from some of the goofy enemy grunts). The unique premise of a man trapped inside his apartment gives way for one of the more interesting plots in a Silent Hill game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A difficult game to rate -- Anodyne 2 shares a lot of the same mediocrity and tedium of its predecessor, but I can&#x27;t help but be impressed by the final product. Whether or not you enjoy this game depends on how much you like the vibe. Overall, gameplay rarely ever exceeds &quot;OK&quot;. Too many of the puzzles are far too easy, too many of the (2D) levels are not fun to explore, too much of the dialogue is a slog to read and too much of the humor falls flat. However, its art direction is entirely captivating; the 3D environments, while mostly empty, are interesting to explore. The soundtrack is one of the best ever seen in an indie game, with its brand of ambient&#x2F;electronic&#x2F;field recordings complementing the levels of the game perfectly. When it comes to atmosphere, Anodyne does an amazing job, and as weird as it sounds, I&#x27;m going to miss inhabiting its world.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A short, cute self-described &quot;Zelda-lite&quot;. Both in looks and gameplay does Anodyne feel like a GB-era Zelda game, probably most similar to Link&#x27;s Awakening, but with less combats &amp;amp; items. Gameplay centers around dungeon exploration, puzzle solving, and platforming. Anodyne leans a little too heavily on the platforming which is mediocre to awful, with weird collision detections between the player and enemies&#x2F;hazards. Overall a decent, if unrefined experience. Music is great though, sounding much like Harry Hosono&#x27;s early ambient work.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Overall a pretty &lt;em&gt;great&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; modern Metroidvania (especially for the price) that makes obvious nods to the Souls-likes and roguelites of the modern era, while remaining refreshingly original artistically. Where Hollow Knight falters is in a few areas where its clear the devs made deliberate design decisions. Hollow Knight is, when it comes to Metroidvanias, remarkably simple; even compared to Super Metroid, the upgrades you attain are straight-forward, un-flashy, and also much less in quantity. This simplicity negatively affects the introductory hours of the game wherein -- since you still lack many of the upcoming upgrades -- your mobility is severely restricted in a map designed with an egregious amount of environmental hazards... which reset the player&#x27;s position with a grating fade-to-black transition upon contact. The result was a mind-numbing slog until I finally gathered the dash and wall-hop abilities (cleverly ripped from Megaman X). A few other decisions (the map purchase system, usefulness of charms, funky hitboxes, use of abilities related to combat) had me scratching my head throughout a mostly enjoyable experience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Faithful to the original and just as polished. DKC2 is considerably more difficult than the original, to the point where the hardest parts of DKC1 look like a cakewalk in comparison. Sometimes, the difficulty verges on straight-up BS. Level design is considerably more vertical in this entry, and this is enhanced with the added mobility of Dixie Kong who, while a tad slower than Diddy, has the invaluable glide ability.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A solid Sonic entry, and a flawless PC port by Christian Whitehead. More in line with Sonic 1 &amp;amp; 2 than 3 &amp;amp; Knuckles. Has some really impressive animations and sprite work, as well as the best music in any Sonic game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - The prequel to Symphony of the Night, Rondo of Blood is the final &quot;classic&quot; Castlevania title before the series ventured into the exploration-focused Metroidvania design. Not to be confused with Dracula X, Rondo of Blood is very similar to Super Castlevania IV although with a few notable improvements and extra features, including multiple playable characters, branching paths that lead to unlockable levels, and fully animated cutscenes. Maria is much more fun to play and less rigid than Richter, although that comes at the cost of making the game a bit too easy at times.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - An imperfect classic, I can clearly see how many of SOTN&#x27;s flaws were overlooked on release and for years following its release. It is one of the most influential games of all time, and is far more ambitious than most of its contemporaries. Some of the best spritework I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Unparalleled atmosphere meets antiquated platforming. Castlevania 4 suffers from a lot of the same platforming woes of other games of its era; in an age where Super Mario Bros. is the single most popular game of all time, how could you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have platforming in your videogame? Although C4 is far less stiff than its predecessors, it can&#x27;t be denied that the platforming is still clunky. Simon moves as gracefully as a bag of sand. You can&#x27;t jump while on stairs. You fall directly through stairs. For some reason, inputting left + up will still move you up the stairs even if &quot;up the stairs&quot; means going right. Putting all of this aside, Castlevania set the bar for action platformers at the time, and its music, visuals, and gothic flair have aged remarkably well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - What was supposed to be the second half of Sonic 3 ends up feeling like a collection of cuts that didn&#x27;t quite make it instead of an equal half. S&amp;amp;K starts out pretty strong, but starts to falter as the game struggles to the finish line. Some bosses are questionable (the first phase of that last boss?) as usual in Sonic games. Knuckles is a great joy to control and makes level traversal far more interesting. My suggestion to newcomers is to just start with the Knuckles campaign.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - The gold standard of tactical role-playing games, and the Matsuno&#x2F;Sakamoto&#x2F;Yoshida trifecta in full force -- masterclass art direction, music, and combat design. Branching story paths and multiple endings that are radically different, where team composition and story choices have real and dire consequences. PSP remake highly recommended.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - About as perfect as 2D platformers get, with arguably the best level design seen in a Nintendo game. Everything here is Miyamoto&#x2F;Tezuka&#x2F;Kondo at their absolute peak. Plain masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Fantastic combat and art direction. Frustratingly imprecise and tedious platforming, which unfortunately, makes up for most of this game&#x27;s challenge. Most of the bosses, while fun, are &lt;em&gt;far&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; too easy (except for that final boss... holy shit). Recommended if you absolutely love punching your TV.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A ridiculously fun mod and twist on the original DOOM Engine games. I played most of Ultimate DOOM with the Brutal DOOM mod using GZDoom. While I loved almost all of the new additions, the level design of DOOM 1 has not aged the greatest. Having been designed with aiming restricted to a single axis of motion, most of the levels feel frustratingly flat when compared to modern shooters. Even with auto-aim turned off, I found it surprisingly easy to mow down enemies until their HP levels got comically high in what felt like artificial difficulty hikes. Otherwise, highly recommended.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Donkey Kong Country is not a perfect game, but it nears perfection so often, I can&#x27;t help but heap mountains of praise on it. The pre-rendered sprites have aged remarkably well, due in part to some impeccable character and level design by Rare &amp;amp; co. Despite rumors that Miyamoto was bitter about DKC and Rare&#x27;s handling of his beloved franchise, the opposite is actually true; Miyamoto played a crucial role in DKC&#x27;s production and gave his blessings to the British development studio. And you can tell -- Donkey Kong Country is distinctively a Nintendo platformer. The soundtrack by David Wise is also an ambient&#x2F;synthwave masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - 2D Sonic at its best on the Genesis. The level design guides the player and actually encourages exploration and for the player to slow down. Roller coaster sections are less frustrating and filled with much less cheap deaths &amp;amp; enemy placements. Level transitions are a great addition, and the OST is significantly better than the previous two entries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - While it suffers from a lot of the same issues as its predecessor, Sonic 2 is much more accessible, entertaining, and diverse than the original. The levels are much more forgiving and receptive to players who just wanna &quot;go fast.&quot; The OST is also significantly improved. A couple of awful levels (Sky Chase Zone) and boring (easy) bosses. Multiplayer is a welcome addition, if not, barebones.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Sonic the Hedgehog contradicts itself regularly. Sonic is supposed to go &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but the screen is so tiny, this results in the player regularly running into spikes or enemies, or a gap where you fall to your death. Fine, Sonic wants me to slow down for some precise platforming. Or maybe not.. because Sonic controls so slippery and the jumping is floaty as all hell. The music is also all over the place. There are probably three &lt;em&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; tracks on here, while the rest ranges from forgettable to downright obnoxious. This game has not aged well, to say the least.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A story-driven puzzle&#x2F;adventure detective story that weaves together themes of mystery, poltergeist, time travel, and the love between owners and their pets. Surprisingly heartfelt for a goofy, anime detective story, but about as contrived and convoluted as you&#x27;d expect from the director of the Phoenix Wright games. All of the puzzles (with the exception of 2 of them...) are clever and satisfying to solve. The characters are all distinct and likable in their own respects. The ending -- while it certainly threw me for a loop -- made me want to hug my cat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gunstar-heroes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#gunstar-heroes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: gunstar-heroes&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Gunstar Heroes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - I know I&#x27;ll be tarred and feathered for this -- I honestly believe this game to be one of the most overrated games of the 16-bit era. I commend Treasure for the spectacle and exhilirating gunplay of Gunstar Heroes, not to mention the fantastic visuals and music. But this game is greatly hindered by a frustrating control scheme, and weird imprecise inputs. The levels are laid out Megaman-style, but vary greatly in difficulty. Some of the boss fights and level checkpoints are just flat out unfair. Better enjoyed with a second player.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;doom-2016&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#doom-2016&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: doom-2016&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;DOOM (2016)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - DOOM is pure video game. Great fun, good challenge, nice visuals, cool music. Some sections are confusingly long-winded, and some of the platforming can feel unnecessary. Otherwise, a perfect revival of a classic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;divinity-original-sin-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#divinity-original-sin-2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: divinity-original-sin-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a flawed game, but it&#x27;s a game that wears its flaws on its sleeve. The first chapter can be a slog, and the amount of players in your party affect the experience greatly. Combat, while difficult from the onset, lures you into a false sense of security midway through the game before the difficulty curve spikes in the penultimate chapter to the point where you&#x27;re wondering if you can even finish the game. So while DOS2 is still a messy, unbalanced, unforgiving Eurogame like its predecessors, its polish, clever gameplay, and sheer ambition make it shine above other modern RPGs.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mega-man-x2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#mega-man-x2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: mega-man-x2&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Mega Man X2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A good follow-up to the influential Mega Man X, albeit, as formulaic as you&#x27;d expect from a Mega Man game. What makes X2 more interesting than the original is the addition of the mid-air dash ability, which dramatically changes X&#x27;s mobility and thus the pace and approach for every boss fight. Highly recommended.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shatter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#shatter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: shatter&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Shatter&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A modern re-interpretation of Breakout&#x2F;Arkanoid-type games. It&#x27;s very, very fun.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sayonara-wild-hearts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#sayonara-wild-hearts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: sayonara-wild-hearts&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Sayonara Wild Hearts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - While the art and music complement each other nicely, Sayonara Wild Hearts feels like a videogame created by a music video director for the sole purpose of being featured in award show trailers and E3 show reels. It &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; amazing, but at its best plays like an awful REZ ripoff, and at its worst (which makes up for most of the playtime) plays like an on-rails, QTE-laden, endless runner with flimsy rhythm game elements that ultimately don&#x27;t really matter unless you really want to chase high scores. Perhaps this is a great game to show to friends and family who have passing interest in videogames, only for the fact that it&#x27;s so flashy and visually appealing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;distraint&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#distraint&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: distraint&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;DISTRAINT&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Cool style, cool art, good job mimicking the psychological horror style made popular by games like Silent Hill. I get strong Yuri Norstein vibes. Story is pretty boring and uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out enough to care about. Overall a decent, short adventure game experience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;abzu&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#abzu&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: abzu&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ABZU&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - ABZU is a beautifully stylish visual experience. The gameplay, however, consists solely of opening doors, and it&#x27;s as boring as it sounds. Character movement only begins to become fun during the last 15 minutes of this 1.5 hour journey.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bleed-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bleed-2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bleed-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bleed 2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A very fun and short indie platformer&#x2F;bullet-hell shmup. Bleed 2 continues in the tradition of the original with responsive controls and super fluid &amp;amp; hyperactive gameplay. The story mode can be completed in about an hour. Bleed 2&#x27;s story mode is forgiving with checkpoints, so I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty. Nice retro graphics and a slick visual style, although with some questionable artistic decisions in regards to character design.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kirby-s-adventure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#kirby-s-adventure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: kirby-s-adventure&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Kirby&#x27;s Adventure is a fantastic platformer that released near the end of the NES&#x27;s lifecycle. It has great level design, sound design, gameplay, and arguably the best visuals &amp;amp; art design of any game on the NES -- they are so good, that this game still looks great to this day. However, the poor NES could &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; handle the sheer amount of enemies and effects going on at once. As a result, if you&#x27;re playing this on the NES or a cycle-accurate emulator (like Mesen), the game will suffer from horrendous slowdown which in turn causes button inputs to be dropped entirely, making the game massively frustrating at times, to flatout unplayable during the most chaotic sections. Kirby&#x27;s Adventure was remade in 2002 for the Gameboy Advance as &quot;Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland&quot; without the slowdown or performance issues. While I do prefer the visuals of the original NES game, I&#x27;d recommend the GBA remake based on my experience with the original. Or you might better off playing using a romhack or different emulator that solves the input-dropping issues (I used Mesen). If not for these performance issues, this game would be an easy 4&#x2F;5.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;am2r&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#am2r&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: am2r&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;AM2R&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - An excellent and much needed reimagining of Metroid II in the style of the GBA-era Metroid games (Zero Mission, Fusion). As a fangame, it near perfectly matches the official Nintendo titles in level design, bosses, and audio&#x2F;visual values.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;remnant-from-the-ashes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#remnant-from-the-ashes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: remnant-from-the-ashes&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Remnant: From the Ashes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - (Co-Op) A third-person shooter&#x2F;RPG hybrid that is often associated with the &quot;Souls-like&quot; subgenre. I would only call Remnant a souls-like superficially. There are the equivalents of bonfires from Dark Souls&#x2F;Demon&#x27;s Souls; boss fights are preluded by fog doors and have multiple phases usually triggered by HP thresholds; you have a refillable health-regen item that you can upgrade with items found in the world. There are other smaller similarities, but otherwise, this game is completely different, with combat that is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; standard, generic third-person shooter-fare (without a cover system, which was an odd exclusion in my opinion). Character builds are based on item&#x2F;weapon bonuses &amp;amp; perks upgraded via &quot;Trait&quot; points. Bosses and environments are nowhere near the quality of Souls games. In particular, there are only 3 environments in this game, 2 of which are painfully underwhelming visually. Campaigns and Adventure modes are semi-procedurally generated with scalable difficulties. There is replay value here, however, this game is meant to be played co-op. Single-player is a bore.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outland&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#outland&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: outland&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Outland&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - (Co-Op) A 2D metroidvania-lite action platformer with a distinct visual style influenced by Southeast Asian mythology. The character abilities are all rather generic for this brand of game, and the enemy variety is severely lacking. This game&#x27;s primary gimmick is its mix of platforming with the polarity system and bullethell style of gameplay, pretty plainly lifted off Ikaruga. Overall the game is challenging enough to be satisfying, especially with another player. Note that online multiplayer suffers from noticeable input lag.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;furi&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#furi&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: furi&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Furi&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A hack-n-slash&#x2F;bullet hell boss rush with a French-anime art style that hearkens back to cyberpunk samurai cartoons you maybe watched as a kid. The mixture of parry-centric swordplay with bullet hell works very well and makes for some exhilirating combat. Some of the bosses have a few poorly designed phases, but overall, the game has good focus and delivers what it promises. The acid-house&#x2F;synthwave electronic music also complements the gameplay fantastically. The writing and &quot;cutscenes&quot; are typical anime dreck.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-players-online&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-players-online&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-players-online&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;No Players Online&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - An interesting (and free!) take on interactive horror that pays homage to first person shooters of the early 00s, and the all too common experience of revisiting a once beloved online multiplayer game, only to find that the servers are completely empty. The concept of haunted digital spaces inhabited by some tormented cyber entity is not a new one, but No Players Online does a great job of inspiring player curiosity and meta-commentary of just what this game actually is. &quot;Completing&quot; the game involves taking part in a kind of scavenger hunt ARG for clues, some of which involve downloading a completely different itch.io title to progress, and calling a phone number (that is now inactive, although the prerecorded message is now on Bandcamp).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;off&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#off&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: off&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;OFF&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Another RPG Maker cult favorite that is unrelenting in fulfilling its author&#x27;s vision. A tough one to place; uses the bog standard out-of-the-box RPG Maker turn-based combat, even keeping the included stock sound effects. The game is translated from French, and at times it felt the translator was leaning a little too heavy on a thesaurus (specifically for the Judge character). The visuals are particularly inspired, being highly surreal and carrying with them a street art-like quality that reminds me of the schizophrenic line art and harsh contrasting colors of Jet Grind Radio. Some confusing use of overly compressed public domain art. OFF seems to relish in its own weirdness a little too much at times, and the gameplay and puzzles suffer for it. An interesting exercise in world-building (which is fitting, given the game&#x27;s plot).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ib&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#ib&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ib&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Ib&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - An RPG Maker modern classic. A horror game with a creepy atmosphere and multiple endings. Cute plot, and inconsistent visuals. Freeware.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minit&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#minit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: minit&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Minit&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A game about swords and corporate greed. But mostly a cute indie game that minifies Majora&#x27;s Mask time travel mechanic to a mere 60 seconds. The gimmick is stretched thin quickly and the game barely does it any justice aside from extract tedium from it. The monochrome graphics, while an obvious stylistic choice, are grating to look at. Decent chiptune music. Fortunately the game does not outstay its welcome.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;celeste&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#celeste&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: celeste&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Celeste&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A fantastic modern platformer that is at times brutally unforgiving. The story presents a nice message but without much subtlety, and is sometimes excruciatingly on the nose. Great soundtrack.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A landmark in open-world 3D game development. After over a decade of sticking to a proven formula, Nintendo took inspiration from the series&#x27; roots and reinvented the series whilst making bold innovations to the genre.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#inside&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: inside&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Inside&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A 2D adventure reminiscent of Limbo. Bleak, haunting presentation with glimpses of a more personal message, tied together with fun puzzles and enjoyable physics-heavy platforming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dragon-quest-iii-snes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#dragon-quest-iii-snes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: dragon-quest-iii-snes&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Dragon Quest III (SNES)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A classic 2D JRPG that influenced a decade of role-playing games to come. Charming dialogue and world-building, undercut by turn-based gameplay that has not aged well, and a ridiculous need for grind.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-witcher-3-wild-hunt&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-witcher-3-wild-hunt&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-witcher-3-wild-hunt&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - Great dialogue, great graphics, great characterization. One of the most fleshed out open-world 3D games ever created.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resident-evil-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#resident-evil-2&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: resident-evil-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A successor to the legendary survival horror video game that hits all the marks and improves upon the gameplay of the original.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resident-evil-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#resident-evil-0&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: resident-evil-0&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Resident Evil 0&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A good rendition of the ol&#x27; Resident Evil formula with worthy visuals and level design. Some clunky new mechanics made its way into this game.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resident-evil-hd-remaster&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#resident-evil-hd-remaster&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: resident-evil-hd-remaster&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Resident Evil HD Remaster&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&#x2F;5&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - The definitive way to play the greatest survival horror game of all time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

The classic collection of design patterns for JavaScript can still be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patterns.dev&#x2F;posts&#x2F;classic-design-patterns&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or better yet at the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;93tHk&quot;&gt;archive link&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

        </author>
        
        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="/new-blog/"/>
        <id>/new-blog/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="/new-blog/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-blog&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#new-blog&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: new-blog&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;new blog&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using and loving &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwtxt.com&quot;&gt;rwtxt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for about a year, I decided I wanted more granular control of my blog, in both its content and styles. The only reasonable answer seemed to be to use a static site generator, but the typical utilization of one entails usage of a text editor to write content (Sublime Text, VSCode, Atom, etc.) While this is an &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; experience, I got really spoiled by the web-based, built-in editor of rwtxt which made updating and creating new content trivial on desktop and mobile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I had a few other requirements for my new blogging platform:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needed to be free. I rarely create content, and I can&#x27;t justify paying money for a shitty anonymous blog like this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needed the ability to add custom styles. rwtxt allowed global styles, but it would be applied to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; page. I wanted control of my stylesheets and directory structure&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needed a web-based editor&#x2F;cms. This is the hardest part. Netlify CMS is the only one I&#x27;ve been able to find.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring and learning how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getzola.org&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I put together the template, contents, styles, and modified the homepage to give room for the blog pagination. I wanted to keep zeit&#x27;s pretty &lt;code&gt;now.sh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; domain, so the Netlify deploy step includes using the now CLI to deploy the static site to &lt;code&gt;now.sh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, as well as deploying to Netlify at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keb.netlify.com&quot;&gt;keb.netlify.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which is a nice bonus to have a mirror site I won&#x27;t have to update separately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting everything up, I can confidently say things work well. But not well enough. And that lies almost entirely with Netlify CMS. The editor is buggy and slow. The Content Manager gives BARELY any customization for how to view my blog entries. As I write this entry, the editor fails to scroll with me as I write content that overflows on the y axis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems my next step will be to find a CMS that interfaces with Github, which is where the code for this site lives (please see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keb&#x2F;keb.now.sh&quot;&gt;github.com&#x2F;keb&#x2F;keb.now.sh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; if you&#x27;re interested).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now this will do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prose.io&quot;&gt;prose.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and it almost perfectly suits my need. Unfortunately, the project is currently unmaintained, with its last commit being in November 2018. But the editor is significantly superior to Netlify CMS. Will likely keep using this and will consider contributing to improve it for my own needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
I have completely ditched Netlify CMS in favor of prose.io. While there is an extra step in that I have to manually add the front-matter to every content file, the control I have over the site repository is refreshing, the editor is leagues ahead of Netlify CMS, and the speed is really remarkable. Using the &lt;code&gt;page.slug&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; variable from zola, I&#x27;m able to quickly reference the appropriate URL for any given content &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file in prose.io. Consider me almost perfectly satisfied. As I said before, I may consider contributing to prose.io in the future. It truly is a great project, and I&#x27;m sad to see its current state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
After using prose.io for about a week and loving its editor, I&#x27;ve decided to just use the built-in Markdown editor included with Github, due to the constant authorization issues I have with prose.io&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy this trend of creating minimal, programmer-friendly static content blog software. Here is a list of several applications I have found over the years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;write.as&#x2F;&quot;&gt;write.as&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writefreely.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;writefreely.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writeas.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;writeas.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bearblog.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bearblog.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwtxt.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;rwtxt.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider using a federated &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-federation.info&#x2F;plume&quot;&gt;Plume&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; instance, or hosting your own.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#misc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: misc&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Misc.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;&quot;&gt;telegra.ph&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;txti.es&#x2F;&quot;&gt;txti.es&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ix.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ix.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commentpara.de&#x2F;&quot;&gt;commentpara.de&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pratice is essential for meditation. Do this when you feel a little overcome by stress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for your desired length of meditation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright somewhere, with your back straight&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close your eyes. Breathe through your nose&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As your breath rises and falls, bring your mind gently to the feeling of the air moving in and out around the tips of your nostrils. Keep your mind there.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this happens, other thoughts&#x2F;feelings will arise. Your foot will itch. Something you want to do immediately after getting up, or two days from now is on your mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note these thoughts and feelings as they come up, try to avoid judging them as good or bad, just notice the thoughts &quot;happened&quot; and gently come back to your breath.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with 5-10 minutes. Try to reach about 40 minutes a day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>/how-to-buy-the-ideal-desk/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="/how-to-buy-the-ideal-desk/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-buy-the-ideal-desk&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-to-buy-the-ideal-desk&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-to-buy-the-ideal-desk&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;how to buy the ideal desk&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that simple flat, sturdy surfaces make for the best desks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had experience with the IKEA Gallant desks (discontinued), and while the surfaces are ideal, the thickness does not allow for clamping monitor mounts without sandwiching a short block of wood between the desk and the clamp.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is typically recommended on message board threads on this very subject to simply buy butcher block, or other kitchen counter tops to serve as your desk surface. They are always more than an inch thick, providing a safe mounting point for any monitor clamps. I feel this is a great choice for a desk surface.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lowes.com&#x2F;pd&#x2F;The-Baltic-Butcher-Block-4-ft-Natural-Straight-Butcher-Block-Birch-Kitchen-Countertop&#x2F;50437226&quot;&gt;$132 - Lowe&#x27;s 4-ft Natural Straight Butcher Block&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A-legs that are typically sold at IKEA are prone to loosening to a point where it cannot tighten again, so you are stuck with the impossible task of leveling your desk perfectly between four legs that won&#x27;t adjust to their default lengths. I spent far too many hours trying to repair A-legs and other adjustable legs until I realized that individual legs are just not worth the hassle. To create a durable, sturdy, and level desk, the best option is to purchase heavy-duty trestles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring several options, I found that two &quot;FINNVARD&quot; trestles from IKEA were the perfect option. They are made of solid wood, are incredibly durable, and as an added bonus, allow for adjustable desk height -- so you get a desk that can alternate between a sitting and standing desk!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;products&#x2F;30345717&#x2F;&quot;&gt;$100 = $50 x 2 - FINNVARD&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So in short:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go for solid, flat, durable tops. Kitchen counter tops are great for this. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#x27;t&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; buy the cheaper honeycomb or balsawood surfaces from IKEA such as the LINNMON. These will warp and bend under moderate weight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the hassle of having to level 4 different legs, and simplify it with trestles. If you&#x27;re really broke, get two identical filing cabinets from an office wholesale seller &#x2F; Craigslist. &lt;strong&gt;Don&#x27;t&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; buy popular adjustable legs from Amazon or IKEA. They are junk.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
