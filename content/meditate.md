# meditate

Pratice is essential for meditation. Do this when you feel a little overcome by stress.

* Set a timer for your desired length of meditation
* Sit upright somewhere, with your back straight
* Close your eyes. Breathe through your nose
* As your breath rises and falls, bring your mind gently to the feeling of the air moving in and out around the tips of your nostrils. Keep your mind there.

As this happens, other thoughts/feelings will arise. Your foot will itch. Something you want to do immediately after getting up, or two days from now is on your mind.

Note these thoughts and feelings as they come up, try to avoid judging them as good or bad, just notice the thoughts "happened" and gently come back to your breath.

Start with 5-10 minutes. Try to reach about 40 minutes a day.
