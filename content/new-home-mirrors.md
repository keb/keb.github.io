# new home / mirrors

Vercel has finally retired their old `now.sh` domains and have migrated all old apps to the new `vercel.app` domain. This was saddening to me, as I had used `keb.now.sh` for a couple years now and loved the tiny domain. "keb dot vercel dot app" does not quite have the same ring to it.

Seeing as I already own the `sheev.net` domain, I decided to ultimately move my site to [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), using a custom domain. I now live on [keb.sheev.net](https://keb.sheev.net), which is cool because my main e-mail *is* `keb@sheev.net` anyway.

In the process, I also explored several other static-site hosting services, and had fun playing around with build and deploy pipelines via Github Actions. From now on, this site has multiple mirrors:

* [keb.sheev.net](https://keb.sheev.net)
* [keb.vercel.app](https://keb.vercel.app)
* [kebg.gitlab.io](https://kebg.gitlab.io)
* [keb.github.io](https://keb.github.io)
* [keb.netlify.app](https://keb.netlify.app)
* [keb.neocities.org](https://keb.neocities.org/)
* [keb.onrender.com](https://keb.onrender.com)
