# simple writing platforms


I enjoy this trend of creating minimal, programmer-friendly static content blog software. Here is a list of several applications I have found over the years.

* [write.as](https://write.as/)
    * [writefreely.org](https://writefreely.org/)
    * [writeas.org](https://writeas.org/)
* [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev/)
* [rwtxt.com](https://rwtxt.com/)

You can also consider using a federated [Plume](https://the-federation.info/plume) instance, or hosting your own.

## Misc.
* [telegra.ph](http://telegra.ph/)
* [txti.es](http://txti.es/)
* [txt.fyi](https://txt.fyi/)
* [verbatim.link](https://verbatim.link/)
* [pastery.net](https://www.pastery.net/)
* [ix.io](http://ix.io/)
* [commentpara.de](https://commentpara.de/)
* [itty.bitty.site](https://itty.bitty.site/edit)
