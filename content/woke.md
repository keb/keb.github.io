# woke

I'm going to take a bit of time to vent about a tweet that I just read. In reference to the latest scandal revolving Netflix, Dave Chapelle, and the LGBT community, someone tweeted:

> I just cancelled my Netflix account, and you should too.

Now it's not the stance/position/ideology of this tweet that bothers me. I admittedly have not kept up with the recent Netflix drama, nor do I really intend to because I believe my time is better spent doing something more productive than indulging myself in the addictive nature of the social media outrage machine. Moreso, it's the moralizing, holier-than-thou posturing, and drive-by blanket implication of "us vs. them" by a person who:

  * Is a Silicon Valley technologist
  * Likely makes a salary that is 800% more than the median American household
  * In nearly every sense of the current trendy political climate, is extremely "privileged"
  * Works at arguably the most powerful corporation in the world
    * A corporation that regularly engages in dark patterns and anti-competitive behavior
    * A corporation that actively censors content, even when it helps oppressive states supress dissent
    * A corporation that surveils their users and sells their data to advertisers at every turn to make a profit
  
Regardless of all these things, you probably shouldn't do what this person did. But the context in particular makes this all the more puzzling and disappointing, and sadly, it seems all-too-common with these Silicon Valley techy types. If this person had any *consistent* sense of justice (as they likely believe), they would quit their job in protest and stop espousing lazy armchair moral advice on social media. Because more likely than not, they don't know what they are actually talking about, and any sense of justice they display is merely an act of parroting the parroted "woke" noise that they've voluntarily surrounded themselves with.
